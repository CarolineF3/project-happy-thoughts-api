This week's assignment was to build a Restful API that allows users to post data.

## The problem

Technologies: Mongo DB, Mongoose, API, Express, Javascript ES6, Node.js

Routes:<br>
GET (/thoughts) - displays all messages<br>
POST (/thoughts) - allows the user to post a new message<br>
POST (/thoughts/:id/like) - allows the user to like a message<br>
